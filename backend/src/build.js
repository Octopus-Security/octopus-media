/**
 * build.js — one string identifying the code this container is running.
 *
 * Portainer polls and deploys on its own; nothing reports back. Without an
 * endpoint that moves when the code moves, a deploy that never landed and one
 * that landed without helping look identical from outside — octopus-science
 * lost three rounds of bug reports to exactly that.
 *
 * ── Derived, not a pasted constant ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * octopus-ee and octopus-science keep `const BUILD = '…'` because their browser
 * code carries the same literal and the comparison needs one. This service does
 * not, and needs the opposite property: a stamp you must remember to bump
 * reports "nothing changed" for a deploy that did, the first time anyone
 * forgets. That is a check failing quietly toward "everything is fine". So it
 * is computed at startup and cannot drift.
 *
 * ── What it covers ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * src/, which is exactly what the Dockerfile copies — the image is package.json plus this directory, so the stamp covers the image rather than a superset of it. The frontend is a separate image with its own build and is not walked here.
 *
 * The files are found by WALKING the directory, not from a list here. A written
 * list stops covering the file just added, and that failure is silent in the
 * worst way: the guard goes quiet exactly for the newest code.
